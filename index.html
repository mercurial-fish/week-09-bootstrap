    <!--TODO    1. Checkout documentation for navbar. Rewatch video on navbar. Check out cheatsheet
                2. Checkout documentation on tables. Rewatch video on Bootstrap components. Refer to cheatsheet
                3. Checkout documentation on forms. Rewatch video on Bootstrap components. Refer to cheatsheet
                4. Checkout documentation on Bootstrap Grid. I am pretty sure stacking vertically has to do with rows/column
                    ex: col-md-4, this is seen in Week 09 Lab and refer to it-->
